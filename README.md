## Abstract
Thermodynamics-informed neural networks employ inductive biases for the enforcement of the first and second principles of thermodynamics. To construct these biases, a metriplectic evolution of the system is assumed. This provides excellent results, when compared to uninformed, black box networks. While the degree of accuracy can be increased in one or two orders of magnitude, in the case of graph networks, this requires assembling global Poisson and dissipation matrices, which breaks the local structure of such networks. In order to avoid this drawback, a local version of the metriplectic biases has been developed in this work, which avoids the aforementioned matrix assembly, thus preserving the node-by-node structure of the graph networks. We apply this framework for examples in the fields of solid and fluid mechanics.  Our approach demonstrates significant computational efficiency and strong generalization capabilities, accurately making inferences on examples significantly different from those encountered during training.

## Methodology

### Key Features:
- **Physics-Informed Bias**: Incorporates the GENERIC formalism for thermodynamic consistency.
- **Local Implementation**: Maintains the local structure of GNNs to improve computational scalability.
- **Encode-Process-Decode Architecture**: Implements a multi-layer perceptron-based pipeline for processing nodal and edge features.

### Supported Scenarios:
- Solid Mechanics: Simulates viscoelastic beam bending in both 2D and 3D.
- Fluid Mechanics: Models fluid sloshing with dynamic particle-based connectivity.


## Results

- Example rollout for the 3D viscoelastic beam bending:
